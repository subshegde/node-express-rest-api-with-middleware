# node-express-rest-api-with-middleware

This repository contains a Node.js and Express.js application for building a REST API to manage user data. The application integrates middleware functions for request processing, including logging and additional request handling. It supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users stored in a JSON file (MOCK_DATA.json). Features include retrieving all users, fetching a specific user by ID, updating user information with PATCH requests, deleting users with DELETE requests, and adding new users via POST requests. While no frontend interface is provided, testing and interaction with the API can be done using tools like Postman. The server runs on port 8000 and utilizes express.urlencoded() middleware for parsing form data. Error handling is implemented for file operations and API endpoints, ensuring robustness in data management and interaction.
